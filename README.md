# Shell
I developed a custom shell interpreter in C++ that replicates the functionalities of widely used shells like Bash. Leveraging Lex for lexical analyzing and Yacc for parsing, it supports complex command syntax and advanced features. 
The shell handles wildcards, environment variables, and subshells, zombie process handling, and command line argument if-statement handling.
